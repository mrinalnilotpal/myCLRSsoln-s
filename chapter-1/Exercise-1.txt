1.1.1 A real world example of sorting can be sorting of student's marks for defining admission criteria. A real life example of convex hull, can be thought of as fencing of two containment zones affected by covid-19. 

1.1.2  Other than speed, memory space also plays a pertinent role for evaluating efficiency of an algorithms. Other parameters can include features like multithreaded, or system independency.

1.1.3 The data structures I have seen before is Array.
  Advantages includes easier access as the data can be indexted to ease the retrieval. Intuitive to understand and work with. Less erroneous.
  Disadvantages are the non-flexibility and the fixed memory size. Doesn't works well with problems like sparse graphs. 
  
 1.1.4 Shotest path and the TSP are related as both of them try to minimise the overall distance travalled. They are different because, Shortest path aims to reduce the disctance between any two points to have shortest path but TSP targets to minimise the shortest path over all the points.
 
 1.1.5 The problems where even small error can cause the large impact on the final results such as temperature monitoring and synchronising systems in Industries. The boilers running at very high temperature risk exploding with even a small change in the temp-press tradeoff.
